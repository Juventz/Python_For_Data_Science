setup.py : the setup file is used to describe the Python package's metadata (name of the package, version, author, etc.), define its dependencies for the package working perfectly and specify how it is built (using pip).

pyproject.toml :the .toml file is a recent format that standardizes dependency management and build tool configuration. It's used for package build management and can/tend to remplace or complete setup.py.
